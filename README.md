## Introduction
Staff Steward is a staff management software that enables micro and small business enterprises to use a cloud-hosted software to keep track of their personnel. It is no secret that micro and small businesses in Kenya hardly keep accurate records of employee information. Not only that, they pay salaries very informally which makes access to business loans that much harder to access. Staff-Steward is their light, user-friendly, cloud-hosted staff management software. What's more, it's open-source!

## Getting Started
**Step 1**
If you have a GitHub account, _navigate_ to the repository containing this README.md file. _Fork_ the repository then head over to your _terminal_ and clone it into your computer. Ensure you have a reputabele code editor installed to ensure you have the best experience interacting with the code.
**Step 2**
Open the cloned directory in your code editor. Open your code editor's terminal, re-check the file path to ensure you are in the right directory.
**Step 3**
Check your node version by running the command **node -v** in your terminal. If your version is lower than version 18, it's advisable to update your node to a more recent release, as you may experience bugs running the code with earlier versions of node.js.
**Step 4**
Run the following commands:
**npm install**(This command will install the node modules you need to run the code. The remote repo does not come with these modules)
then Run:
**npm run dev** 
This script starts a Node.js server using node server.js. It will start your development environment without manually starting your server each time.
