## Introduction
Staff Steward is a staff management software that enables micro and small business enterprises to use a cloud-hosted software to keep track of their personnel. It is no secret that micro and small businesses in Kenya hardly keep accurate records of employee information. Not only that, they pay salaries very informally which makes access to business loans that much harder to access. Staff-Steward is their light, user-friendly, cloud-hosted staff management software. What's more, it's open-source!
